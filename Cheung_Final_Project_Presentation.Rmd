## Some Populations Disproportionaly Impacted By Disasters

- Low-Income Individuals and Families
- People of Color
- Older Adults
- People with Disabilities
- Those with Limited English Proficiency


## The Center for Disease Control and Prevention's Social Vulnerability Index (SVI)


- Measures the ability to respond to and recover from disasters.
- Provides an index between 0 and 1.
- An SVI of 1 is considered highly vulnerable.
- Areas with high SVI have higher levels of loss caused by disasters.

## Has COVID-19 Had A Disproportionate Impact In Our Region?

- Given the limited scope - somewhat
- Of the two SVI characteristics looked at individuals with less education and lower income had disproportionate experiences with:
  - Employment income loss
  - Food Insufficiency
  - Housing Insecurity
  - Feelings of Anxiousness
- High SVI areas tend to have higher rates of COVID-19 deaths
